# The fix for point 14 relies on self._character_manager having a public or protected _npc_manager.
# CharacterManager's __init__ does not show npc_manager being stored on self directly.
# This means the call in activate_ability: `self._character_manager._npc_manager_ref.get_npc` will fail.
# A proper fix requires CharacterManager to store and provide access to NpcManager,
# OR NpcManager to be injected into AbilityManager directly.
# For this subtask, I'll inject NpcManager into AbilityManager's __init__
# and use self._npc_manager in activate_ability.

#                     target_entity = self._npc_manager.get_npc(guild_id_str, target_id) # Removed await
# This means I need to add NpcManager to AbilityManager's __init__ and store it.
# The current file does not have npc_manager in __init__. I will add it.
# The TYPE_CHECKING block for CharacterManager also does not list npc_manager.

# Given the tool limitations, I will apply the overwrite with the assumption that
# GameManager will correctly inject NpcManager into AbilityManager.
# The constructor change is part of this fix.

# Final check on helper methods (Point 5,9,11):
# _format_ability_list_for_character, _format_ability_description, _get_ability_target_prompt
# are still not in the file. These points are not applicable.
# The core methods like learn_ability and activate_ability already have character/caster None checks.
