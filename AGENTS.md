# AI Agent Memory Log

## Core Operating Instructions (Provided by User)

*   **Task Management:**
    *   Always retrieve tasks from `Tasks.txt`.
    *   Compare these tasks with those already listed in `done.txt`. Do not repeat tasks that are in `done.txt`.
    *   Upon completing a task from `Tasks.txt`, record it in `done.txt`.
*   **Memory Usage (`memory.md`):**
    *   Use this file (`memory.md`) to log important points, suggestions for improvements, and information about what has already been done.
*   **Current Directive (Full Project Testing):**
    *   Conduct a full test of the project.
    *   If test files themselves contain errors, fix them.
    *   When a test identifies a bug in the project code, stop testing and focus on fixing that bug.
    *   After fixing a bug, conduct a re-test.
    *   Proceed step-by-step until problems are resolved.
*   **Task Analysis:**
    *   Tasks in `Tasks.txt` might not be fully prepared or some might be underdeveloped. Record such observations in this local memory (`memory.md`) for better future orientation.

## Objective
The primary goal is to analyze the `Tasks.txt` file, conduct comprehensive testing of the AI-Driven Text RPG Bot project, identify and fix bugs, add necessary tests, and maintain a log of all actions and findings in this file, following the core operating instructions above. Completed tasks from `Tasks.txt` will be recorded in `done.txt`.

## Initializing Work (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC)
- Started the process.
- Current plan:
    1. Run Pytest: Execute all collected tests using `poetry run pytest`.
    2. Analyze Test Results.
    3. Isolate and Understand the Failure.
    4. Fix the Bug.
    5. Re-run Tests.
    6. Document Task Issues.
    7. Update `done.txt`.

## Previous Work Summary (from prior session)
- **Test Directory:** `tests/` is well-structured, mirroring the main project.
- **Pytest Usage:** `tests/conftest.py` present. `pyproject.toml` lists `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `pytest-mock` in dev dependencies, confirming Pytest as the runner.
- **Initial Test Collection Fixes:**
    - Resolved 6 test *collection* errors primarily related to incorrect import paths and missing class definitions.
    - Examples:
        - `ImportError: cannot import name 'LocalizedString' from 'bot.utils.i18n_utils'`
        - `ImportError: cannot import name 'CharacterAlreadyExistsError' from 'bot.game.exceptions'`
        - `ImportError: cannot import name 'GameLog' from 'bot.database.models.log_event_related'`
        - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bot.game.managers.rule_engine'`
- **Previous Conclusion:** All test collection errors were resolved. 984 tests were collected successfully.

## Current Focus & Activities
- **Dependency Installation:** Encountered multiple `ModuleNotFoundError` errors when attempting to run `poetry run pytest`. This indicated missing dependencies.
- **Action Taken:** Ran `poetry install --with dev` to install all project dependencies, including development ones. This step completed successfully, installing 81 packages.
- **Next Step:** Re-run `poetry run pytest` to execute the tests now that dependencies should be correctly installed.

## Pyright Error Fixing Phase (Batch 1)

- **Focus:** Addressing Pyright static analysis errors from `pyright_summary.txt`.
- **Strategy:** Fixing errors in batches of ~10, prioritizing files with fewer errors first. Committing each batch.
- **Batch 1 Fixes (10 errors committed in `fix-pyright-schemas-utils-sqlite-batch1`):**
    - `bot/api/schemas/ability_schemas.py` (2 errors): Fixed Pydantic `Field` usage (explicit `default` keyword for default values, ensuring other metadata like `description`, `example` are passed as keyword arguments).
    - `bot/api/schemas/location_schemas.py` (2 errors): Similar Pydantic `Field` usage fixes.
    - `bot/api/schemas/player_schemas.py` (2 errors): Similar Pydantic `Field` usage fixes. Addressed a field override variance for `discord_id` in `PlayerRead` schema by explicitly defining it and adding a `# type: ignore[override]` comment.
    - `bot/command_modules/utility_cmds.py` (2 errors): Added missing `await` keywords for asynchronous calls to `character_manager.get_character_by_discord_id` to resolve `CoroutineType` assignment errors.
    - `bot/database/sqlite_adapter.py` (2 errors): Removed non-standard `is_closed()` method calls on `aiosqlite.Connection` objects, as this attribute/method is not standard and was causing errors. Connection state is now inferred differently.
