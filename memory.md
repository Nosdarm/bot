# AI Agent Memory Log

## Objective
The primary goal is to analyze the `Tasks.txt` file, conduct comprehensive testing of the AI-Driven Text RPG Bot project, identify and fix bugs, add necessary tests, and maintain a log of all actions and findings in this file. Completed tasks from `Tasks.txt` will be recorded in `done.txt`.

## Initializing Work (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC)
- Started the process.
- Current plan:
    1. Initialize `memory.md`.
    2. Understand the Testing Environment.
    3. Address "Фаза 0" from `Tasks.txt`.
    4. Iterative Testing and Fixing for "Фаза 0".
    5. Update `done.txt`.
    6. Submit Changes after "Фаза 0".

## Current Focus
- Understanding the testing environment of the project.

## Testing Environment Investigation & Initial Run
- **Test Directory:** `tests/` is well-structured, mirroring the main project.
- **Pytest Usage:** `tests/conftest.py` present. `pyproject.toml` lists `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `pytest-mock` in dev dependencies, confirming Pytest as the runner.
- **Dependencies:** `pyproject.toml` (Poetry) and `requirements.txt` list necessary testing libraries. Spacy models are also included. Dependencies installed using `poetry install --with dev`.
- **Initial Test Run (`poetry run pytest`):**
    - **Result:** Test collection failed with 6 errors.
    - **Collection Errors (Initial):**
        1.  `ImportError: cannot import name 'LocalizedString' from 'bot.utils.i18n_utils'` (in `bot/cogs/master_commands.py` via `tests/cogs/test_master_commands.py`)
            *   **Fix:** Changed `LocalizedString` and `translate_string` usage in `bot/cogs/master_commands.py` to use `get_localized_string` from `bot.utils.i18n_utils.py`.
            *   **Side effect:** Encountered `ValueError` for slash command name too long (`master_modify_location_connection`). Renamed it and `master_remove_location_connection` to `master_mod_loc_connection` and `master_del_loc_connection` respectively in `bot/cogs/master_commands.py`.
        2.  `ImportError: cannot import name 'CharacterAlreadyExistsError' from 'bot.game.exceptions'` (in `tests/commands/test_game_setup_cmds.py`)
            *   **Fix:** Added `CharacterAlreadyExistsError` class to `bot/game/exceptions.py`.
        3.  `ImportError: cannot import name 'GameLog' from 'bot.database.models.log_event_related'` (in `tests/database/test_models_structure.py`)
            *   **Fix:** Changed import from `GameLog` to `StoryLog` in `tests/database/test_models_structure.py` and updated its usage in internal lists, based on `Tasks.txt` (Task 17) and model definition.
            *   **Side effect:** Encountered `NameError` for `CraftingRecipe` and `Relationship` in `tests/database/test_models_structure.py`. Fixed by adding them to the import from `bot.database.models.game_mechanics`.
        4.  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bot.game.managers.rule_engine'` (in `tests/game/managers/test_dialogue_manager.py`, `tests/game/managers/test_status_manager.py`, `tests/game/utils/test_stats_calculator.py`)
            *   **Fix:** Corrected import path from `bot.game.managers.rule_engine` to `bot.game.rules.rule_engine` in all three affected test files, as `RuleEngine` is defined in `bot/game/rules/rule_engine.py`.
    - **Warnings:** Numerous Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, and other deprecation/user warnings were observed during collection. These will need to be addressed later.
- **Conclusion:** All test collection errors have been resolved. 984 tests were collected successfully. The next step is to proceed with the actual testing as per "Фаза 0" of `Tasks.txt`.
